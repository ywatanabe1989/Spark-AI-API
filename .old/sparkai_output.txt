My name is Claude. It's nice to meet you!

Certainly! Here's a simple Python code for "Hello, World!":

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is the most basic Python program you can write. When you run this code, it will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

If you want a slightly more interactive version, you could try:

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This program asks for the user's name and then greets them personally. When you run it, it will look something like this:

```
What's your name? Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

Feel free to ask if you'd like to see any other Python examples or if you have any questions about Python programming!
